DDpy provides a module for Python3 containing functions to interface with the dislocation dynamics functionality of MoDELib 2.
This introduces Python3 and Pybind11 as dependencies.

Scripts to test some of the functionality may be found in tutorials/DislocatioinDynamics/periodicDomains/uniformLoadController/DDpy .
